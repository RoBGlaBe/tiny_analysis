# Tiny Analysis

Way simpler variante of [Straxen's](https://github.com/XENONnT/straxen) Mini-analysis that is meant to be used with an old version of [Strax](https://github.com/AxFoundation/strax) that is currently used at the Darwin R&D TPC in Freiburg. Once we update to the latest version of strax this repo becomes obsolete.

### Example of current usage:
```
import events_tiny

events_tiny.event_waveform(Context, run_id, **kwargs)
```
